      <p>Hi! I'm a software developer based in Denver, Colorado. I'm currently learning all I can about front-end development at Turing School of Software & Design in Downtown Denver.</p>

      <p>Prior to my transition into making sweet code, I spent five years helping other companies accomplish their goals through financing and strategic advice giving. While I loved hob-nobbing with powdered wigs and building righteous spreadsheets, I was drawn to the creativity and complexity of the JavaScript community.</p>

      <p>This realization found me teaching myself to code and eventually in the midst of the passionate developers at Turing. I'll graduate from the program in April 2017 ready to find an awesome team that values true relationships, elegant code, and beautiful designs.</p>
